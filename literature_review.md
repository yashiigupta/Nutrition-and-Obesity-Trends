## 1. Health effects of dietary risks in 195 countries, 1990–2017: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 - The Lancet, 2019

### Description
This comprehensive global study examines the relationship between dietary factors and health outcomes across 195 countries. The research investigates 15 key dietary risk factors and their contribution to non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer, and spans from 1990 to 2017.

### Research Methodology and Dataset Sources
The study employs the Comparative Risk Assessment Framework from GBD 2017, utilizing data collected from multiple authoritative sources including national nutrition surveys, FAO databases, Euromonitor, and the Global Nutrient Database. The research methodology combines spatiotemporal regression analysis, meta-analysis techniques, and Monte Carlo simulations with 1000 iterations to ensure statistical reliability. The team calculated Population Attributable Fractions (PAFs) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) to quantify the health impacts of dietary risks.

### Final Insights
The research revealed that poor dietary habits were responsible for approximately 11 million deaths and 255 million DALYs in 2017, accounting for roughly 22% of all adult deaths globally. High sodium intake, low whole grain consumption, and insufficient fruit intake emerged as the most significant dietary risk factors. While age-standardized rates showed some improvement over time, the study highlighted that poor diet has surpassed tobacco as a leading cause of death. The findings emphasize the critical need for promoting balanced diets rich in whole foods and implementing effective food policies to address these dietary challenges.
