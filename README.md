# Nutrition and Obesity Trends

## Project Overview

Nutritional habits are deeply linked to public health outcomes, particularly obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Over the past 50 years, globalization and industrialization of food production have transformed dietary patterns worldwide. This project investigates how diets are shifting globally, which countries are experiencing the fastest growth in obesity, and the roles of dietary diversity, food affordability, and economic status in shaping nutritional health.

Using global nutrition datasets from FAO and USDA, along with obesity and health outcome statistics, this analysis aims to understand long-term nutrition trends and their health impacts.

## Problem Statement

Nutritional habits are deeply linked to public health outcomes, particularly obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Over the past 50 years, globalization and industrialization of food production have changed how and what we eat. Using global nutrition datasets (FAO, USDA) and obesity/health outcome statistics, students will investigate how diets are shifting, which countries face the fastest growth in obesity, and how dietary diversity, food affordability, and economic status shape nutritional health.

## Key Questions

- Which countries consume the highest levels of sugar, fat, protein, and fiber? Are there regional patterns (e.g., Western diets vs. Asian diets)?
- How do obesity and diabetes rates correlate with national dietary consumption patterns?
- Are global diets becoming more homogenous (same foods across cultures), or do distinct regional diets persist?
- Which food groups (processed foods, dairy, cereals, fruits/vegetables) have changed most in consumption over the past 50 years?
- Does income predict not just calorie intake but also quality (nutritional diversity, balance between processed and fresh foods)?
- Can an interactive visualization show per capita nutrient consumption trends by country and nutrient across years?
- What predictive and descriptive analyses can be drawn from the aggregated data? What is the overall analysis philosophy, design, and methodology?

## Project Methodology Summary

- Aggregate nutrient consumption data per capita yearly for each country.
- Analyze consumption patterns of key nutrients (sugar, fat, protein, fiber) and food groups.
- Correlate dietary trends with obesity and diabetes rates.
- Examine the impact of income and economic factors on nutritional quality.
- Develop interactive visualizations to explore trends by country and nutrient over time.
- Implement predictive models to estimate future obesity trends based on historical data.
- Document comprehensive findings with rationale, analysis philosophy, and methodology description.
